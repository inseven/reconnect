import SwiftUI

// This approach feels fairly messy, but I can't think of a better way to do it as the `.handlesExternalEvents` modifier
// doesn't appear to work on the SwiftUI `Settings` scene. This view modifier is therefore expected to be used on the
// main window and uses the new `.openSettings` environment key to, after a short delay to allow the main window to be
// created, open the settings. Hopefully this is fixed in the future.
