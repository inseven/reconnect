# Hardware

In order to connect your Psion to your Mac, you'll need a couple of bits of hardware: an RS232 adapter, and a suitable link cable.

## RS232 Adapter

RS232 adapters using an [FTDI](https://ftdichip.com) chipset are the most reliable on macOS and are recommended. [This one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WJS26WX) from Amazon US seems to work well.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com.tw/) adapters can be made to work, but the default drivers that ship by default with macOS are unreliable so you'll need to install the [official drivers](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pl2303-serial/id1624835354).

[Alex Brown](https://oldbytes.space/@thelastpsion) has done some pretty rigorous testing of different adapters which you can find on his [Hackaday blog](https://hackaday.io/project/161291-the-last-psion/log/222358-usb-rs232-shenanigans-updated-2025-05-28).

## Link Cable

The link cable you need depends on the type of Psion you have. Unfortunately these can be a little expensive now, but [Psionex](https://psionex.co.uk) still have stock at relatively competitive prices.
